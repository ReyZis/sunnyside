## Overview

I mainly started this project for the goal of refreshing my knowledge of vanilla JS, since one can get too used to the latest technologies such as react, firebase, mongoDB... etc.
It is a common routine for me to start a new little project which i can take it easy with, and i really suggest it for my fellow developers.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

as every vanilla html, css, js project go, i start with building the foundamental structure of a section in html, then i move to styling it using css, then when finishing with the final look that I am satified with, i try to make responsive with every pc screen.
then i reapeat this process with every section in the page.
after I am finished, I started working on the mobile version, which took me a couple of adjestment using @media.

Why didn't I work with "Mobile-first workflow"?. just because :p.
